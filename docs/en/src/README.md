# Introduction

Welcome to my Kernel From Scratch (KFS) project documentation! This repository contains my implementation of the Ã‰cole 42 "Kernel From Scratch" curriculum, consisting of 10 progressive projects designed to explore and understand kernel architecture from the ground up.

Ferrite is an experimental kernel written in Rust. Just as fungal networks in nature create vast, efficient systems for resource sharing, Ferrite aims to provide a robust foundation for process communication and resource management.

> This project is in early stage development. While it's exciting to experiment with, it's not yet ready for production use.

## This Book

This book contains more indepth information about my technical approach & a more blog-style writing about each project to get to the current point I am at.
